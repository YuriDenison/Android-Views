Edit text with clear button
===================

To use ButtonEditText specify "android:drawableRight" and visibility mode.

Supported visibility modes:
- always: always show button
- whenFocusedAndNotEmpty: show only when focus is on the field and text is not empty
- whenFocused: show only while editing
- never: never show clear button

You can update mode on runtime using setter.
